# Active Context

## Current Task
Memory Bank initialization — created `memory-bank/` structure per `CLAUDE.md` (this directory did not previously exist in the repo).

## Branch / Commit
- Branch: `main`
- HEAD at session start: `e1e57e9` — "docs: update README for Closed Beta launch (4 Aug 2026)"
- Working tree has untracked files not yet committed: `.github/workflows/closed-test-deploy.yml`, `CLAUDE.md`, `assets/word documents/key.properties`, `assets/word documents/upload-keystore.jks`, `distribution/`, `docs/google_closed_testing.md` — appear to be in-progress Closed Beta release setup (CI workflow, signing keystore, distribution assets). Not created or modified by this session.

## Decisions Made This Session
- Populated all 6 core Memory Bank files from direct repo inspection (pubspec.yaml, PHASE_LOCK.md, AGENTS.md, README.md, firestore.rules, lib/ structure, git log, TODO.md) rather than from assumption or the README's Turkish marketing claims alone.
- Flagged README's "Closed Beta active / 12/12 bridges connected / 0 critical errors" as an unverified documentation claim, not confirmed repo state — see `progress.md`.
- Preserved CLAUDE.md's stated precedence: where `AGENTS.md` (older, narrower scope — excludes social features) conflicts with CLAUDE.md's current approved scope (which includes friends/group rides/leaderboards), CLAUDE.md wins. Recorded in `projectbrief.md`.
- Did not run `flutter analyze` / `flutter test` this session (no code change made) — verification gate status is therefore "not verified," not "passing," pending an actual task.

## Blockers
None currently. No active implementation task.

## Update (same session, 2026-08-04) — Docs Cleanup
User asked to read all `.md` files in the repo, fold anything important into the Memory Bank, and clean up the rest. Read all ~20 `.md` files (root, `docs/`, `assets/word documents/`). Findings folded into Memory Bank:
- `systemPatterns.md`: Rider Card spec pointer, Speed Telemetry Engine V2 pipeline summary, AHRS pocket-mode mechanism (ties to the pocket-telemetry-zeroing risk), Android package ID, typography spec pointer.
- `techContext.md`: iOS native build/runtime gotchas (iCloud build-path signing failure, `home_widget` duplicate-plugin crash fix, Firebase iOS App ID format, `GMSServices` init requirement, foreground notification delegate), Google Play Closed Testing facts (package `com.apexflow.app`, tester/promotion thresholds).
- `progress.md`: Phase 9.1 optimization items listed as "claimed done per PHASE_LOCK.md/commit 887ad57, not independently verified in code."

After explicit per-file confirmation via AskUserQuestion, deleted 9 stale/conflicting `.md` files (git-tracked, recoverable via history if needed):
- `docs/APEXFLOW_MVP_FIRST_CODEX_EXECUTION_BIBLE.md` (explicitly banned social/friends/leaderboard features that CLAUDE.md now approves — superseded by its own generated `AGENTS.md`/`DESIGN_RULES.md`/`PHASE_LOCK.md`)
- `docs/ROADMAP_PHASES.md` (out of sync with `PHASE_LOCK.md` — showed Phase 8 as next when Phase 9.1 is marked complete)
- `docs/HANDOFF_FOR_AI.md`, `docs/MISSION_VISION.md`, `docs/DEVELOPER_GOALS.md` (content superseded by `projectbrief.md`/`productContext.md`/`progress.md`; contained stale Phase 1-7 / "73/73 tests" claims)
- `docs/DEVELOPER_REQUESTS.md` (stale rules: "Firestore backup-only" contradicts current `firestore.rules` scope; Chrome-only preview note outdated)
- `docs/DEVLOG.md` (historical dev journal — user chose to remove in favor of Memory Bank + git log)
- `PHASE_9.1_NEXT_TASKS.md`, `PHASE_9_OPTIMIZATIONS_ROADMAP.md` (planning docs for work `PHASE_LOCK.md` marks complete; summarized into `progress.md` instead)

Kept untouched (still current/active, or explicitly required by CLAUDE.md): `AGENTS.md`, `DESIGN_RULES.md`, `PHASE_LOCK.md`, `AHRS_POCKET_MATH.md`, `IOS_DEPLOYMENT_NOTES.md`, `docs/APEXFLOW_SPEED_TELEMETRY_ENGINE_V2.md`, `docs/RIDER_CARD_SPECS.md`, `docs/COMPANY_PROFILE.md`, `docs/MARKETING_DESIGNS.md`, `docs/APEXFLOW_MADEFORTH_DISCORD_QA_BUG_REPORT_ENGINE_MASTER_SPEC.md`, `docs/google_closed_testing.md`, `docs/README.md`, `assets/word documents/APEX_FLOW_PREMIUM_TYPOGRAPHY_SYSTEM_ANTIGRAVITY_SPEC_V1.md`, `TODO.md`, root `README.md`, and all `.txt` architecture specs in `docs/` (out of scope — user asked about `.md` files only).

Updated dangling references: `docs/README.md` reading order and root `README.md` documentation links now point to `memory-bank/` instead of the deleted files.

## Next Step
Awaiting the user's next task. When one arrives:
1. Re-check `git status` for further changes to the untracked release files above before touching anything nearby.
2. Read only the Memory Bank / source files relevant to that specific task (per CLAUDE.md's token-efficient session protocol) — this file plus `progress.md` should be sufficient to resume; `projectbrief.md`/`productContext.md`/`systemPatterns.md`/`techContext.md` are reference, not required reading every session.
